The surge in Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed our daily lives, linking everything from home gadgets to industrial equipment. According to \cite{number_of_iot_devices}, the number of these IoT devices will almost double from 2023 to 2030, to a number of aproximately 30 billion devices. While this connectivity brings convenience, it also raises important security concerns. IoT devices, now included inside many homes and facilities, require a focus on security to address potential risks. This paper aims to explore the security aspects of IoT devices, emphasizing the need for practical measures. One such important security measure is called Moving Target Defense (MTD).\\
MTD methodology typically falls under the category of proactive security measures, as it aims to evade security threats, thus making it more difficult for an attacker to deliver a malicious payload.\\
The objective of this paper is to provide a overview of the existing body of knowledge. By scrutinizing contemporary literature, research papers, and case studies, this document aims to focus on the current state of MTD in IoT, elucidating the key principles, challenges, and potential strongpoints for future exploration.
