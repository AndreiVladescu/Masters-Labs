This study investigates the efficacy of Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategies in bolstering the security of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. With the escalating integration of diverse and resource-constrained IoT devices into critical infrastructures, traditional security measures prove insufficient against evolving threats. Our research assesses MTD techniques, such as dynamic network reconfiguration and software diversity, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing resistance to both known and zero-day attacks. The adaptive nature of MTD mechanisms ensures continuous adjustments, providing robust protection for systems, such as IoT devices. These findings provide insights for developers, security engineers, and researchers in search of adaptive solutions to safeguard IoT ecosystems from the ever-changing threat landscape.
